Network Handbook
===

This repository contains the Latex sources for a minimal network handbook that covers mostly Cisco systems administration. Some topics include

- Getting started with new network hardware
- Learning about the IOS commands
- Setting up a VLAN
- Adding SSH support for switches

However, there are some drawbacks

- The document is currently written in French (was originaly made for study goals)
- It's written as a summary (minimal explanations)

Hope it may help you on some networking topics.
